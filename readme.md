SQL Helper for PHP
==================

The purpose of this small piece of code is to have a simple sql-helper that makes writing queries faster, simpler and more secure.

It is convention-based, and expects the objects to map directly to the database. It can automatically append prefix to tables and will escape all values to guard against SQL injection.

Initially, it will only work with MySQL.
